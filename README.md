# dotfiles
Personal system config files (vim, bash, initial setup, etc.) :smiley:
  
### Note to self
*  For vim-plug, do not forget to use the command `:PlugInstall` on first run.  
*  setup-new.sh contains all the packages that may be desirable, comment out 
   the things not needed now.  
*  Remember to create ssh key.
